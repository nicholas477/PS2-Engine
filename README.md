# PS2-Engine
A fun little PS2 game engine i'm working on. Nothing serious

Currently supports textured model rendering, fog, and music and that's about it.

# How to compile
1. Install PS2DEV (https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev)
2. Clone this repo
3. Run compile.sh (it will clone and compile all the necessary repos)
